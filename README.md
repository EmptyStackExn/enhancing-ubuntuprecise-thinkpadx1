Here is a cheatsheet that gathers tips I applied to [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/) with [GNOME 3 Fallback Session (Classic)](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+package/gnome-session-fallback) on my [Lenovo ThinkPad X1](http://www.lenovo.com/mp/x1/index.html).
